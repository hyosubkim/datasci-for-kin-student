    "**Hints:**\n",
    "- You can use a 1000x1000 2D matrix to represent the grid of lights\n",
    "- Here is some python code you can use to load in the input file, and for each line, split the instructions into a list of items:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    with open(\"data/A6_input.txt\") as fp:\n",
    "      for line in fp:\n",
    "          e = line.strip().split(\" \")\n",
    "          print(e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will need some if statements to determine which instruction it is, and how to act on them.\n",
    "- The `.split()` method is your friend.\n",
    "- Remember to add 1 to the second x-coordinate and the second y-coordinate, to handle how Python indexes into arrays. For example, Z[0:5] results in the first, second, third, and fourth values of the array Z. To get the first 5 values you would have to use Z[0:6].\n"
